# LECTURE_08.26


# Writing exercise

1. What do you want to get out of this class/experience
2. What agreements do you need to have with one another? Make proposals to discuss with your team
3. How can we deal with different levels of committment?

# Discussion of Team Goals, Agreements

We went around and invited each team member to discuss their answers by going in 
a circle on question 1, question 2, and then question 3.

Each team member was asked to at least say their name on each round, 
but it is ok to "pass" if they prefer not to share anything about their answer
to that question.   

# NEXT: In a fork of your team repo

* Add a directory called cs56
* Under that directory, add m18
* In that directory add README.md
* In that file, record your team member names (just first names) and your agreements
* Do a pull request.

This will count towards the project grade for your team.
